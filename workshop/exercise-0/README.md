# Pre-work

This section is broken up into the following steps:

1. [Accessing WeTTy](#1-accessing-wetty)
1. [Accessing the OpenShift console](#2-accessing-the-openshift-4-console)
1. [Accessing IBM Cloud Transformation Advisor](#3-accessing-ibm-cloud-transformation-advisor)


## 1. Accessing WeTTy

Various parts of this workshop will require access to the OpenShift 4 CLI. In order to minimize student laptop setup requirements
an Ubuntu 18.04 VM has been setup for the use of the students. Access to that VM is provided via [WeTTy](https://github.com/butlerx/wetty) a browser based terminal emulator written entirely in JavaScript.

1.1 Verify that you can access the WeTTy terminal using the URL provided to you by your instructor.
